STEP 1: from plaintext to matrix
    cleaning up the plaintext
    conversion of characters into numbers

To encrypt:

STEP 2: method that key matrix by multiplies plaintext vector (matrix),
        while converting numbers into modulo 26

To decrypt:

STEP 3: need to get adjugate matrix
STEP 4: need to get inverse determinant modulo 26
        include checks if the inverse exists
STEP 5: get inverse of key modulo 26,
        which is the product of STEP 3 and STEP 4
